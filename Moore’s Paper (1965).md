# Moore’s Paper (1965)

## Cramming more components onto integrated circuits

## Context

When Moore wrote this paper in 1965, the most advanced computer was the CDC 6600, whose size still filled the room.

## Summary

- The paper primarily focuses on providing insight into the future regarding the development trend of computers. Moore, as the engineer and co-founder of FairChild, has a deep understanding of current semiconductors in his time (as well as chemistry and physics background), and made several predictions based on observation.
- The paper is absolutely fascinating as most of the ideas he projected into the future have come true. He speculated home computers that will become widespread (Altair 8800 (1974) - The first commercially successful home computer using Intel 8080), portable cell phone devices, auto-drive mobiles, smart watches, as well as the concept of dis-aggregated memory, which is a popular area of research as of 2024.
- He makes key observations of integrated electrons (microelectrons technology) invented in late 1950s, which is relevantly new to 1965 when he wrote the paper.

## Strengths

- He is *familiar with the current technology* (semiconductor integrated circuitry are already using the improved thin-film resistors by applying such films directly to an active semiconductor substrate) and *he listens to other researchers in the field* (many researchers believe the way of the future to be a combination of the various approaches) and observes companies’ reactions (compan[ies]… have machines in design or in early production employing integrated electronics). Combined with *reflection and critical thinking* (linear circuitry only used in military, but also notes that there are ongoing efforts using it in commercial production), he pieces together the present and *boldly envisions the future*.
- correlates the field of chemistry and analyzes the economics along with computer science, since in the real world, one field’s development is often related to other fields.
- with expertise in physics and chemistry, Moore correctly predicts that silicon likely remains the basic material for semiconductor technology.
- his economics prediction is accurate with there being a minimum cost in decreasing number of components per chip.
- “I believe that such a large circuit [65,000 components per integrated circuit] can be built on a single wafer.”

## Weakness

- Moore's predictions on manufacturing yield and heat dissipation proved inaccurate. Both have become primary obstacles in scaling.
- It is interesting that, despite Moore’s chemistry background, his claim “no barrier exists comparable to the thermodynamic equilibrium considerations that often limit yields in chemical reactions” was too conservative.
- Cutting edge technology today operate at near-atomic scales, and manufacturing now faces the very chemical reaction constraints Moore originally dismissed.

## Reflect

- Moore was truly ahead of his time. His insight comes from his awareness of the world around him and his educational and technical background, both of which are equally important.
- It would be quite impossible to have such accurate predictions into the future at present time. At Moore’s time, technology had a distinct direction and general trend, whereas  today's technology landscape resembles a branching tree of possibilities. Any direction could become the future innovation given the current memory bottleneck. Near memory computing, in memory computing, and PCM all possess possibility to dominate the market into the near future.
- Nevertheless, it is important to think like Moore and realize that expertise in seemingly distinct fields can converge to drive innovation. This inspires me to pursue my interests in other fields, knowing they will eventually contribute somehow to my future work in computer science.

## Takeaways/Comment

- Only multifaceted knowledge can lead to key insights. It is crucial to combine several factors when making an observation - Moore exemplified this by synthesizing his understanding of manufacturing economics, market forces, and technological possibilities.
- Researchers should avoid becoming isolated in their specific domains. Instead, they should actively observe the world around them, track what others are working on, and stay attuned to trends in related fields. This broader awareness helps shape deeper understanding and amplifies the potential impact of current work.
- Moore's approach shows that breakthrough insights often emerge not from narrow expertise, but from the ability to connect developments across different domains and recognize their combined implications for the future.
